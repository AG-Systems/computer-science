Version 1:
Read the customers age and item price
If the customer’s age is less then 65, do this:
        Assign 0 as the discount rate
        Print the amount due
Else, do this:
        Assign 10% as the discount rate
        Calculate the amount due by subtracting the discount rate from the number 1, and then       	multiplying the result by the item price.
        Print the amount due
