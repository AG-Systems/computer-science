# This file has some strings that are used in the string test to check
# reading strings from files. The default overloaded >> of your string 
# class should skip over any leading spaces and read characters into
# the string object, stopping at the first whitespace character (this is
# similar to the behavior of >> on char *).  The read method of the
# string class is a little fancier. It allows client to restrict
# how many characters at max to read and what character to use as 
# delimiter, so you can stop at newline instead of space, for example.
# Reading consumes the delimiting character, so the next read starts 
# after that.
#
The  first  time  we  will
    read individual words, next    
we read whole lines
